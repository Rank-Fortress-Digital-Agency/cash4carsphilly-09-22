                    You have a few options when you’re looking to sell a catalytic converter. You could try to sell it to a scrap yard or post an ad online. But consider using an online marketplace instead. Here are some reasons why:

                <br>
                <p>
                    Scrap yards typically don’t offer the best prices for catalytic converters. And if you post an ad online, you might not get much response. But by using an online marketplace, you’ll be able to reach a wider audience of potential buyers. And because there’s more competition, you’ll likely get a better price for your converter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you’re ready to sell, take some photos of your converter and create a listing. Be sure to include the make, model, and year of the vehicle it came from. It would be best if you also mentioned whether it’d been cleaned or not. Once you find a buyer, arrange a time and place to meet. It’s always best to exchange money in person to ensure you receive payment. And that’s it! You can quickly sell your catalytic converter with little effort and earn extra cash.

And you can rest assured that you’ll get paid, as most online marketplaces offer buyer protection.
